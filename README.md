    A remake of the classic <strong>T-Rex Runner</strong> game!  
    Jump and avoid obstacles in this endless runner inspired by the famous Chrome browser offline game.  
    Built with performance and flexibility in mind using C++ and SFML.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> This is not a fully finished game. The main mechanics have been implemented, but there is still room for further development.</p>
